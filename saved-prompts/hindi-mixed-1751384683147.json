    "userPrompt": "For each entry in the CSV snippet below, return exactly four CSV fields: the key, a Hindi + English mixed translation plus two metadata fields of category classification and translation reasoning. The order will look like: \nKey, hi_Deva, Category, Reasoning\n\nIf the ‘Target Translation’ cell in the input is non-empty, still output a fresh Hinglish translation and begin Reasoning with “Modified:”.\n\nThe hi_Deva field will be a “mixed script”:  \n• Hindi words in Devanagari  \n• English words in Latin script  \n• Terms in the KEEP list (below) always stay English (Latin), other English words may remain English when more natural.\n\n\nRULE 1 Placeholders – preserve EXACTLY\n\n• Curly-brace placeholders {alphaNumeric}               → regex \\{[A-Za-z0-9_]+\\}\n• ICU plurals            {n} inside keys …one / …other\n• Hash pattern           #{number}                      → treat \"#\" as literal text\n• Punctuation after token {percentile}% , {hour}:{minute} → keep punctuation intact\n• Dart interpolation     $variable                      → regex \\$[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*\n• Highlighter tags       {highlighter}…{/highlighter} (if ever present)\n\nRules that supersede all others  \n1. Never transliterate, reorder, or wrap placeholders with Hindi diacritics. \n2. Do not change the spelling of any placeholder token.  \n3. Every placeholder must appear exactly once in the output; word order outside placeholders may change to suit Hindi syntax.\n\n\nRULE 2 Tone & Style\n\n• Use **आप** for user-facing text; use an impersonal / passive construction (“कृपया…”) in System & Error.\n• Sentence case for buttons, headers, and short labels.\n• Max one “!” where allowed (see grid); none in Error or System.\n• No emojis.\n• Prefer everyday English UI / ed-tech words; avoid rare Sanskritisms.\n• Terms in the KEEP list must remain English, Latin script.\n• Do not insert ISO diacritics in Latin words (write “karo”, not “karō”).\n• Aim for gender-neutral phrasing **using colloquial Hinglish** (e.g., “sab log”, “sab users”); avoid formal words like “उपयोगकर्ता”.\n• When the string is spoken **in first-person by the product’s tutor persona (“Sarah”, “AI Tutor”, “Personal English Speaking Partner”, etc.) use the feminine possessive and agreement: “मैं आपकी … हूँ”.  Never use “आपका”.\n• When mixing scripts, ensure Hindi words appear in Devanagari, English words in Latin.\n\n\nRULE 3 Length  (mixed Devanagari + Latin)\n\n• Expansion flags  \n  – If the English source is 7–25 characters and len(hi_Deva) ÷ len(English) > 1.6 → explain in Reasoning.  \n  – If the English source is > 25 characters and the same ratio > 1.25 → explain.\n\n• Tight-UI caution (buttons, chips, tabs)  \n  – For keys or comments that indicate a compact component—e.g. names containing\n    “cta”, “btn”, “button”, “chip”, “tab”, or “nav”—keep the Hinglish output as short as\n    *or shorter than* the English text whenever a natural synonym exists.  \n  – If you *must* exceed the English length to stay natural in Hindi, state the final\n    ratio in Reasoning and note the potential overflow: “Warning: compact-UI risk; ratio 1.45”.\n\n• No numeric cap for English strings ≤ 6 characters.\n\nRULE 4 Glossary (KEEP list)\n\nKEEP Stimuler, IELTS, CEFR, PRO, Premium, Paywall, Login, Logout, Profile, Settings,\n     Streak, Dashboard, Lesson, Quiz, Test, Flashcard, Speaking, Listening, Reading,\n     Writing, Grammar, Vocabulary, Practice, Review, Score, Progress, Badge, Level,\n     Goal, Hint, AI Tutor, AI Call, Upgrade, Subscription, Trial, Download, Upload \n\nRULE 5 Category Classification\nChoose ONE category from this list (use exact spelling):\n• Onboarding - welcome messages, initial setup, first-run experience, introductions\n• Gamification - achievements, rewards, streaks, progress celebrations, badges\n• Progress - performance updates, statistics, learning metrics, feedback\n• Conversation - AI tutor dialogue, chat interactions, speaking practice\n• Practice - exercise instructions, lesson content, practice activities\n• Test-Prep - exam preparation, IELTS content, test-specific material\n• Pricing - subscription offers, payment, upgrades, paywall messages\n• Notification - alerts, reminders, push notifications, time-sensitive messages\n• Error - error messages, warnings, validation feedback, failure states\n• Social - sharing features, social accomplishments, community features\n• Profile - user profile, library, settings, personal preferences\n• System - technical messages, legal text, terms, system status\n\nRULE 6 Translation Reasoning (be thorough but concise)\nProvide comprehensive explanation covering:\n• Placeholder handling (if any were reordered or required special attention)\n• Word choice rationale (why specific terms were selected)\n• Grammar/tense decisions (why past/present/future, formal/informal)\n• Cultural adaptations (what was adjusted for Indian context)\n• Tone adjustments (how you matched the category's tone requirements)\n• For modifications: Start with \"Modified:\" then explain (1) what changed and (2) why the original was inadequate\n• If the entire hi_Deva or Reasoning field contains even one comma , , plus sign +, double quote \" , or newline \\n, wrap the whole field in double quotes, then double every internal \"\nExample:\nkey_with_quotes,\"\"\"Error\"\" message है, कृपया retry करें\",Error,\"Added quotes; wrapped & escaped per rules. Kept retry in english because of mainstream understanding\"\n\nOUTPUT\n\nReturn **CSV rows only**, no header, no markdown. \nKey, hi_Deva, Category, Reasoning\n\nIMPORTANT CSV FORMATTING:\n\n- ALWAYS copy the Key from the input exactly as the first field.\n- If ANY character inside hi_Deva or Reasoning is a comma, double quote, or newline, wrap the ENTIRE field in double quotes \"…\".\n- After wrapping, double every interior double quote:  →  \"\".\n- Every row MUST have exactly 4 fields separated by commas\n- Do NOT wrap the entire response in markdown code blocks\n- Return ONLY the CSV rows, no additional text\n- Example: purpose.ielts,\"Hello! मैं Sarah हूँ. मैं आपकी मदद के लिए यहाँ हूँ.\",Conversation,\"Replaced Hindi greeting 'नमस्ते!' with English 'Hello!' to keep friendly Latin opening.
