    "systemPrompt": "You are an expert app localiser with 10 + years of UI/UX and marketing-copy experience across multiple languages.",
    "userPrompt": "For each entry in the CSV snippet below, output four CSV fields in this order:\nKey, te_Telu, Category, Reasoning\n\n- te_Telu = is a mixed-script string with Telugu words in native Telugu script + English words in Latin script.\n\n- Terms in the KEEP list always stay English (Latin); any other English word may remain English when that feels more natural in UI copy.\n\n- If the input row already contains a Telugu target, still overwrite it and start the Reasoning with “Modified:”.\n\n- Output CSV rows only—no header, no Markdown.\n\nCRITICAL RULES (NEVER VIOLATE):\n  1. Preserve ALL tokens exactly: {placeholders}, $variables, <tags>\n  2. Never translate text inside < > brackets or { } braces\n  3. Return exact CSV format: Key, Translation, Category, Reasoning\n\nCOMMON FAILURES TO AVOID:\n• <bold> → <దట్టంగా> (WRONG - never translate tags)\n• {userName} → {వాడుకరి_పేరు} (WRONG - never modify placeholders)\n• Splitting <bold>{name}</bold> into separate parts (WRONG - keep together)\n• Adding quotes around category names (WRONG - use bare words)\n\nRULE 1 — Tokens & Tags: preserve EXACTLY\n\n• Curly-brace placeholders {alphaNumeric} → regex {[A-Za-z0-9_]+}\n• ICU plurals {n, plural, one {…} other {…}} — keep block intact\n• Hash pattern #{number} → treat \"#\" as literal text\n• Dart interpolation $variable → regex $[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9]*\n• Fixed-punctuation tokens {percentile}% {hour}:{minute} (punctuation stays)\n• Highlighter pair {highlighter}…{/highlighter}\n• Rich-text tags: <bold>, <underline>, <highlight>, <br> etc. — preserve exactly\n    – Never translate tag names or text inside < > brackets\n    – Keep exact nesting: <bold><underline>text</underline></bold>\n    – If {placeholder} appears inside tags, move together as a unit\n\nRULE 2 Tone & Style\n• Use polite second-person “మీరు” for user-facing text; use impersonal/passive Telugu (“దయచేసి…”) in System & Error.\n • Sentence case for buttons, headers, and short labels.\n • Maximum one “!” where allowed (see Rule 5); none in Error or System.\n • No emojis.\n • Prefer everyday English ed-tech words; avoid heavy Sanskritisms.\n • KEEP terms stay English.\n • Do not add ISO diacritics in Latin words (“karo”, not “karō”).\n • Aim for gender-neutral Telugu phrasing (e.g., “అన్ని వినియోగదారులు”); avoid stiff bureaucracy words.\n • When the text is spoken in first person by the tutor persona (“Sarah”, “AI Tutor”, etc.), write:\n “నేను మీ … ని.” (Telugu has no gender marker in 1st-person verbs, so neutrality is fine.)\n • Telugu words in Telugu script, English words in Latin—keep the scripts distinct.\n • Refer to the Rule 5 below for the tone of every string.\n\nRULE 3 Length (mixed Telugu + Latin)\n• Expansion flags\n – If the English source is 7–25 characters and len(te_Telu) / len(English) > 1.6, note the ratio in Reasoning.\n – If the English source is > 25 characters and the ratio exceeds 1.25, note it.\n• Tight-UI caution (cta / btn / chip / tab / nav)\n – Keys or dev notes containing those terms must keep the Telugu+English output ≤ English length whenever a natural synonym exists.\n – If you must exceed it, append in Reasoning:\n Warning: compact-UI risk; ratio 1.45 (replace with actual ratio).\n• No cap for English strings ≤ 6 characters.\n\nRULE 4 Glossary (KEEP list)\nStimuler, IELTS, CEFR, PRO, Premium, Paywall, Login, Logout, Profile, Settings,\n Streak, Dashboard, Lesson, Quiz, Test, Flashcard, Speaking, Listening, Reading,\n Writing, Grammar, Vocabulary, Practice, Review, Score, Progress, Badge, Level,\n Goal, Hint, AI Tutor, AI Call, Upgrade, Subscription, Trial, Download, Upload\n\nRULE 5 Category Classification & Tone\nChoose ONE category and apply its tone:\n• Onboarding - welcome messages, initial setup, first-run experience, introductions; warm, welcoming, “మీరు”, courteous\n• Gamification - achievements, rewards, streaks, progress celebrations, badges; celebratory, ≤ 1 !, “మీరు”, moderate hype\n• Progress - performance updates, statistics, learning metrics, feedback;

functional labels, terse, “మీరు”\n• System - technical messages, legal text, terms, system status; impersonal/passive Telugu, unambiguous, Telugu legal register\n\nRULE 6 Reasoning field – include concisely but completely\n• How placeholders were handled \n• Word-choice logic \n• Grammar/politeness\n• Cultural tweaks \n• Tone-grid match \n• Length warnings\n• Modifications: start with Modified: then explain what changed and why.\n•If the entire te_Telu or Reasoning field contains even one comma , , plus sign +, double quote \" , or newline \\n, wrap the whole field in double quotes, then double every internal \"\nExample:\nkey_with_quotes,\"\"\"Error\"\" సంభవించింది, దయచేసి retry చేయండి\",Error,\"Added quotes; wrapped & escaped per rules. Left retry in English for clarity\"\n\nOUTPUT\nReturn rows like:\ncomplete_profile,\"మీ Profile ని పూర్తి చేయండి\",Profile,\"Used KEEP term \"\"Profile\"\"; polite imperative; no placeholders.\"\n\nIMPORTANT CSV FORMATTING:\n- ALWAYS copy the Key from the input exactly as the first field.\n- If ANY character inside te_Telu or Reasoning is a comma, double quote, or newline, wrap the ENTIRE field in double quotes \"…\".\n- After wrapping, double every interior double quote:  →  \"\".\n- Every row MUST have exactly 4 fields separated by commas\n- Do NOT wrap the entire response in markdown code blocks\n- Return ONLY the CSV rows, no additional text\n- Example: purpose.ielts,\"నమస్తే! నేను Sarah, మీకు సహాయపడేందుకు ఇక్కడ ఉన్నాను.\",Conversation,\"Swapped informal 'Hey!' for culturally appropriate 'నమస్తే!'. Used first-person neutral Telugu per tutor persona rule. Present tense adds immediacy.\"\n- Example: error.network,\"Network connection error\",Error,\"Kept concise English phrase to match tech jargon familiarity. Calm, solution-oriented tone. No exclamation per Error guidelines.\"\n- IMPORTANT: Category must be one word from the list, no quotes\n- CRITICAL: Each row MUST start with the exact key from the input entries\n- CRITICAL: Return EXACTLY one output row for each input entry - never combine entries\n- CRITICAL: If an input entry has multiline English text, still return only ONE output row for that key\n\nSome translation examples (for reference)\n• English: Complete your profile\n – Telugu + English: మీ Profile ని పూర్తి చేయండి\n• English: Chat with Sarah Anytime, Anywhere you want to…\n – Telugu + English: Sarah తో ఎప్పుడైనా, ఎక్కడైనా chat చేయండి…\n• English: LIMITED TIME OFFER\n – Telugu + English: LIMITED TIME OFFER\n• English: The app is brilliant! You can’t find anything better than that…\n – Telugu + English: ఈ app అద్భుతం! దాని కన్నా మెరుగైనది మీరు కనుగొనలేరు. మీరు మాట్లాడగానే, ఇది మీ speech-ను IELTS band, grammar, fluency, intonation తదితర పరంగా అంచనా వేసుతుంది.\n• English: Save\n – Telugu + English: Save\n"
