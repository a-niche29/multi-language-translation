    "userPrompt": "For each entry in the CSV snippet below, produce a Brazilian-Portuguese (pt-BR) translation plus two metadata fields including category classification and translation reasoning.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────\n\nCRITICAL RULES (NEVER VIOLATE):\n  1. Preserve ALL tokens exactly: {placeholders}, $variables, <tags>\n  2. Never translate text inside < > brackets or { } braces\n  3. Return exact CSV format: Key, Translation, Category, Reasoning\n\nCOMMON FAILURES TO AVOID:\n• <bold> → <negrito> (WRONG - never translate tags)\n• {userName} → {nomeDeUsuario} (WRONG - never modify placeholders)\n• Splitting <bold>{name}</bold> into separate parts (WRONG - keep together)\n• Adding quotes around category names (WRONG - use bare words)\n\nRULE 1 — Tokens & Tags: preserve EXACTLY\n\n• Curly-brace placeholders {alphaNumeric} → regex {[A-Za-z0-9_]+}\n• ICU plurals {n, plural, one {…} other {…}} — keep block intact\n• Hash pattern #{number} → treat \"#\" as literal text\n• Dart interpolation $variable → regex $[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9]*\n• Fixed-punctuation tokens {percentile}% {hour}:{minute} (punctuation stays)\n• Highlighter pair {highlighter}…{/highlighter}\n• Rich-text tags: <bold>, <underline>, <highlight>, <br> etc. — preserve exactly\n    – Never translate tag names or text inside < > brackets\n    – Keep exact nesting: <bold><underline>text</underline></bold>\n    – If {placeholder} appears inside tags, move together as a unit\n\nRULE 2  Tone & style\n• Follow the tone in rule 5.\n• Use você in friendly buckets; use o(a) Senhor(a) or an impersonal voice in System / Legal.  \n• Sentence case for buttons and headers.  \n• One “!” allowed in Gamification, Social; avoid in Error or Legal.  \n• No emojis.  \n• Prefer neutral collectives (“a comunidade”, “as pessoas usuárias”) when easy; avoid duplicating gendered endings.\n\nRULE 3 Length\n• For English 7–25 chars: if Portuguese grows ≳60 % (`len_ratio > 1.6`), explain in reasoning.  \n• For English >25 chars: explain if `len_ratio > 1.25`.  \n• No numeric cap for ≤ 6-char English strings.\n\nRULE 4 Terminology (glossary)\nKEEP / TRANSLATE exactly as flagged.\n• KEEP Stimuler, IELTS, CEFR, Sarah, Premium, PRO, Roadmap, Streak, Paywall, Onboarding (internal labels)\n• TRANSLATE Trial → \"teste gratuito\"; Subscription → \"assinatura\"; Upgrade → \"atualizar\"; Mentor → \"mentor(a) / mentoria\"; Callback / Call → \"chamada\"\n• AI mixed rule Keep \"AI\" inside fixed branded phrases (\"AI Call\", \"AI Tutor\"); elsewhere translate to \"IA\".\nOnboarding: translate to \"Introdução\" when it appears on an end-user screen.\n\nRULE 5 Category Classification & Tone\nChoose ONE category and apply its tone:\n• Onboarding - welcome messages, initial setup, first-run experience, introductions; warm, welcoming, você form, courteous\n• Gamification - achievements, rewards, streaks, progress celebrations, badges; celebratory, ≤ 1 !, você form, moderate hype\n• Progress - performance updates, statistics, learning metrics, feedback; encouraging, data-driven, motivational yet precise, você form\n• Conversation - AI tutor dialogue, chat interactions, speaking practice; natural spoken Portuguese, concise, você form, avoid technical jargon\n• Practice - exercise instructions, lesson content, practice activities; clear instructional imperatives, você form, neutral enthusiasm\n• Test-Prep - exam preparation, IELTS content, test-specific material; formal instructional, exam terminology, você form, precise language\n• Pricing - subscription offers, payment, upgrades, paywall messages; benefit-oriented persuasion, transparent, você form\n• Notification - alerts, reminders, push notifications, time-sensitive messages; direct voice, courteous, mild urgency when appropriate, você form\n• Error - error messages, warnings, validation feedback, failure states; calm, solution-oriented, sentence case, você or impersonal\n• Social - sharing features, social accomplishments, community features; upbeat, first-person when sharing, ≤ 1 !, friendly você form\n• Profile - user profile, library, settings, personal preferences; functional labels, terse, você form for actions\n• System - technical messages, legal text, terms, system status; formal o(a) senhor(a) or impersonal construction; Brazilian legal register; no exclamations\n\nRULE 6 Translation Reasoning (be thorough but concise)\nProvide comprehensive explanation covering:\n• Word choice rationale (why specific terms were selected)\n• Grammar/tense decisions (why past/present/future, formal/informal)\n• Cultural adaptations (what was adjusted for Brazilian context)\n• Tone adjustments (how you matched the category's tone requirements)\n• Placeholder handling (if any were reordered or required special attention)\n• For modifications: Start with \"Modified:\" then explain (1) what changed and (2) why the original was inadequate\n• If choosing between multiple possible categories, briefly justify your choice\n\nOUTPUT\nReturn CSV rows in this exact order, with no header:\nKey, Portuguese Translation, Category, Translation Reasoning\n\nIMPORTANT CSV FORMATTING:\n- ALWAYS include the Key from the input as the first field (copy exactly)\n- Use double quotes (\") to wrap any field containing commas, quotes, or newlines\n- Escape inner double quotes by doubling them (\"\")\n- Every row MUST have exactly 4 fields separated by commas\n- Do NOT wrap the entire response in markdown code blocks\n- Return ONLY the CSV rows, no additional text\n- Example: purpose.ielts,\"Olá! Eu sou a Sarah e estou aqui para te ajudar.\",Conversation,\"Replaced greeting 'Hey!' with culturally appropriate 'Olá'; used você form for a friendly AI tone; kept present tense to convey immediate availability.\"\n- Example: error.network,\"Erro de conexão de rede\",Error,\"Added 'de rede' for technical clarity; kept calm, factual tone without alarming language; omitted exclamation to follow Error-category solution-oriented style.\"\n- IMPORTANT: Category must be one word from the list, no quotes\n- CRITICAL: Each row MUST start with the exact key from the input entries\n- CRITICAL: Return EXACTLY one output row for each input entry - never combine entries\n- CRITICAL: If an input entry has multiline English text, still return only ONE output row for that key"
