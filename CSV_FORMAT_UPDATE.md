# CSV Format Update - Implementation Summary

## Problem Fixed
The AI was returning "s concise" instead of proper translations because:
1. Your prompts expected "CSV snippet below" but received no CSV data
2. The code was only sending the English text, not the full CSV row
3. The parser's fallback logic accepted "s concise" as a valid translation

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced TranslateOptions Interface
Added `key`, `source`, and `language` fields to provide full context to the AI:
```typescript
export interface TranslateOptions {
  text: string;
  key: string;
  source: string;
  language: string;
  systemPrompt: string;
  userPrompt: string;
}
```

### 2. Updated Translation Providers
Both OpenAI and Anthropic providers now:
- Create a CSV row with new headers: `Key,Source,English Original`
- Append this CSV data to prompts containing "CSV snippet below"
- Pass language information for validation

### 3. Modified Parallel Translation Engine
- Passes full entry data (key, source, text) to providers
- Includes language name from translation group

### 4. Enhanced Response Validation
- CSV parser now validates responses against target language
- Detects style descriptors like "s concise" and rejects them
- Provides meaningful error messages

## What the AI Now Receives

Instead of just:
```
For each entry in the CSV snippet below...
[Nothing follows]
```

The AI now receives:
```
For each entry in the CSV snippet below...

onBoarding.canIknowYourName,Static,I am so excited, Can I know what's your name ?
```

## Expected AI Response Format
The AI should now return properly formatted CSV:
```
onBoarding.canIknowYourName,"Estoy muy emocionado, ¿Puedo saber cuál es tu nombre?",Onboarding,"Translation reasoning..."
```

## Benefits
1. ✅ AI receives the full context it expects
2. ✅ Prompts and code are now aligned
3. ✅ Invalid responses like "s concise" are rejected
4. ✅ Better error messages for debugging
5. ✅ Language-specific validation

## Testing
After these changes:
1. Upload your CSV file
2. Use your existing saved groups (they'll work with the new code)
3. The AI should receive proper CSV data and return valid translations
4. Use the Debug Panel to monitor AI responses in real-time
